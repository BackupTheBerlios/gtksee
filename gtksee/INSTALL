o System requirements:
    Required: 1.0.0 <= GTK+ <= ?
    Optional: libjpeg libtiff libpng wmftogif

    If you don't have these libraries, go to

    ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware/source/xap/libgr/

    and get them. Install libgr, and everything should work fine. :)   

    If you want to enable wmf files support you should have wmftogif binary.
  It's contained in <Caolan.McNamara@ul.ie>'s libwmf package, available at:

    http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/docs/libwmf.html

o Compile and install:
    1. Choose your favorite icon first. See icons/README.icons
    2. Then type:
       $ ./configure
       $ make
       $ make install (become root)

o If configure didn't detect your GTK+:
    Add GTK+ prefix option. For example:
    ./configure --with-gtk-prefix=/usr/local/gtk
    Don't forget to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH first:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gtk/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

o If configure didn't detect your libs:
    Add directory options. For example:
    ./configure --with-im-incs=/usr/local/include --with-im-libs=/usr/local/lib
